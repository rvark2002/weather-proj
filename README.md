Ritvik Varkhedkar and Thomas Klaus
Introduction
Natural Disasters, A powerful, uncontrollable force of nature that causes damage and casualties wherever it occurs. Natural Disasters come in many forms - from hurricanes to ice storms, fires, and earthquakes. With the damage and destruction caused by Natural Disasters, it is essential to analyze and find trends in data to prevent damage caused by future storms. In this project: 1) we aim to analyze a data set of Natural Disasters (obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/us-natural-disaster-declarations )

2) Look for patterns or trends in many visual forms - graphs, maps

3) Look at potential correlating factors

4) provide a replicable tutorial so that one can come up with their conclusions
